{"name":"rebootPianoteq4","tagline":"rebootPianoteq4 - A Mac OS X .App / bash script to handle tedious tasks ..","body":"### Welcome to the rebootPianoteq4 GitHub Project Page.\r\nThis project aims to provide a simple & automated way to handle tedious tasks necessary to effisciently use the Pianoteq4 trial ...\r\n\r\naka \"close -> relaunch -> close trial dialog -> engage sustain pedal\", & loop over these steps again every 19 minutes ( the \"time lock\" being of 20 minutes )\r\n\r\nIt 's intended to be run from the command line or by using the .App, docked or not, for easy & handy access to the end user.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nThe project can be used in two different ways:\r\n\r\n-> launched like any other app, and closed like any other app OR by clicking on the \"rotating cogwheel\" in the Mac OS X OS top bar --> to do so, we'd use the .app\r\n\r\n-> launched from the cli, and stopped/close when hitting \"Ctrl-C\" --> to do so, we'd use the  \"./stag_rebootPianoteq4.sh\" command to launch the bash program handling necessary stuff (...)\r\n\r\nNote that either way, once it's running, the \"watching process\", while in use, displays a rotating cogwheel in Mac OS X top bar. If the user wants to stop it, he can either right click the icon in the dock or click the cogwheel icon in the top OS bar & selecting \"stop process\" BUT! -> line right below ;) If the \"watching process\" was launched using the current bash script and thus from the cli, it is appropriate to just \"Ctrl-C\" the script & let it handle the necessary \"cleanup\" by itself.\r\n\r\n-> If for any reason, the bash script weren't able to stop the \"watching process\" as well as closing itself after the user hit \"Ctrl-C\", then the \"watching process\" 'll still be stoppable by either right clicking the icon in the dock or clicking the rotating cogwheel icon in the top OS bar & selecting \"stop process\", as we do while using the .app ( rebootPianoteq4.app ).\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n```\r\n# this is the way we use the program from the cli\r\n$ ./stag_rebootPianoteq4.sh\r\n(..)\r\n# to stop the background \"watching process\" & quit rebootPianoteq4, simply hit \"Ctrl-C\"\r\n$ <Ctrl-C>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nStephaneAG ( @StephaneAG )\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFeel free to contact me for any help, suggestion, or related stuff.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
