{"name":"rebootPianoteq4","tagline":"rebootPianoteq4 - A Mac OS X .App / bash script to handle tedious tasks ..","body":"### Welcome to the rebootPianoteq4 GitHub Project Page.\r\nThis project aims to provide a simple & automated way to handle tedious tasks necessary to using the Pianoteq4 trial ...\r\n\r\naka \"close -> relaunch -> close trial dialog -> engage sustain pedal\", & loop over every 19 minutes\r\n\r\nIt 's intended to be run from the command line, else one can prefer to use the .App, docked or not, for easy access.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nThe project can be used in two different ways:\r\n\r\n-> launched like any other app, and closed like any other app OR by clicking on the \"rotating cogwheel\" in the Mac OS X OS top bar --> to do so, we'd use the .app\r\n\r\n-> launched from the cli, and stopped/close when hitting \"Ctrl-C\" --> to do so, we'd use the  \"/stag_rebootPianoteq4.sh\" command to launch the bash program handling necessary stuff (...)\r\n\r\nNote that either way, once it's running, the \"watching process\", while in use, displays a rotating cogwheel in Mac OS X top ( status ?) bar. If the user wants to stop it, he can either right click the icon in the dock or click the cogwheel icon in the top OS bar BUT! -> line right below ;) If the \"watching process\" was launched using the current bash script and thus from the command line, it is appropriate to just \"Ctrl-C\" the script & let it handle that by itself.\r\n\r\n-> If for any reason, it couldn't stop the \"watching process\" as well as closing itself when hitting \"Ctrl-C\", the \"watching process\" can still be stopped by either right clicking the icon in the dock or clicking the rotating cogwheel icon in the top OS bar, as it's done while using the .App to launch rebootPianoteq4.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n```\r\n# this is the way we use the program from the cli\r\n$ .//stag_rebootPianoteq4.sh\r\n\r\n(..)\r\n\r\n# to stop the background \"watching process\" & quit rebootPianoteq4, simply hit \"Ctrl-C\"\r\n$ <Ctrl-C>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nStephaneAG ( @StephaneAG )\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFeel free to contact me for any help, suggestion, or related stuff.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
